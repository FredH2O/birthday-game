        This little game is inspired by one of my favorite things in the whole
        wide world: petting cats! I just love their soft fur, their cozy purrs,
        and the way they make everything feel calm and happy. My favorite cats
        of all are the orange onesâ€”warm and bright like little furry suns. So
        come play along and join me in a simple celebration of all things cat!
